# Weather App

A weather app with google maps, you can mark map where you want to see the weather in nearby cities.

Available in https://deftweatherapp.netlify.app/

## Techinical choices

I like to work with this stack: ReactJs with Material UI and Styled Components.

Material UI has amazing components and the documentation is so good with styled components I can styled components in code, I think it's so good in development time and the ReactJs component code stay clean.
Another advantage about Material UI is the Mobile first methodology, you can build web apps for almost all devices.

I used the React Router DOM library for navigation using components like (Link, Redirect, Route, Switch, useLocation) to build this SPA.

For the best user experience when loading pages I used imports dynamics from ReactJs.

For data manipulation I used hooks useState and useEffect, between the Home page to city-info page I only send the data in state location and get in city-info with hook useLocation.

For GoogleMaps I used google-maps-react because I compare with others dependencies, then, I think google-maps-react is more simple than others and I liked more his documentation.

## Default settings for environment variables

Create a '.env.local' file at the root of your application, with the following variables:

```
BROWSER=none

REACT_APP_API_KEY_GOOGLEMAPS=
REACT_APP_API_OPEN_WEATHER=
```

# Initial config

First you need to install dependencies with command `yarn`
After that follow available scripts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
